# üèÜ Strapi community website competition üèÜ

We from the [@strapi-community](https://github.com/strapi-community) are hosting a website development competition that you can participate in! In this readme you will find all the info you need to enter the competition and win cash prizes.

## üìù Specification

We want a website to represent the [@strapi-community](https://github.com/strapi-community). To help us promote our cause and represent everybody that is helping us grow. The backend API for this website will be made with Strapi (offcourse), and for the frontend we want **you** to build it! We will give away $1000 in prize money for the top three submissions, and the number one submission will actually be used as the frontend of our website.

What we're hoping to get from this competition is a concept version of what this website could look like. It doesn't matter how you build it, and it doesn't need to be production ready. We want a static design that we can build upon.

The competition will be ran for the entire month of February. Allowing you to enter your submissions up until February 28th at midnight. Afterwards we will take one week to decide on a winner before making the anouncement.

## üí∏ Prize pool

1. **$500** First prize
2. **$300** Second prize
3. **$200** Third prize

In addition to the prize money the winner will forever be mentioned in the readme of this repo as the winner of this competition and as the person who made the initial efforts to built the Strapi Community website.

## üì• How to enter

To enter the competition you will have to fork this repo and submit a PR with your submission. Once we have decided on a winner we will merge the winning PR and implement it as our website.

## üì¢ Requirements

For the website there are no designs so you have a lot of creative freedom. Though, there are a couple of hard requirements.

1. The website can be built with any kind of frontend framework, or even just plain HTML. Build it how ever you see fit.
2. Feel free to use any kind of CSS framework, or build it from scratch
3. The website should be responsive
4. Create a `INSTALL.md` file consisting of instructions on how to run the app
5. The design should align with the [strapi design system](https://design-system.strapi.io/) at least in terms of colors.
6. The website should contain at least the following elements:
  	- Navigation/menu
  	- A hero component to showcase featured content and click through with a button
  	- A card to show clickable content in a grid
  	- Basic form elements (input, checkbox, radio's, textarea, button)
	  - An example form using the form elements
  	- Typography styling (h1, h2, h3, p, a)
  	- Footer

### üìú Page implementation

A valid submission should contain **one** of the following three pages to showcase all the components as a whole.

#### The home page
This page should consist of at least a hero component that functions as a call-to-action to click through to another page.
The rest of the page should be used to showcase the [@strapi-community](https://github.com/strapi-community). You are open to build the rest of this page however you want.

#### The about page
This page will be used to elaborate in more detail about what the [@strapi-community](https://github.com/strapi-community) is and how we work. The contents of this page could be lorem ipsum, all we expect is a template that we can use to fill in our selfs.

#### The bounty page
The [@strapi-community](https://github.com/strapi-community) will be offering bounties for certain plugins to be built for Strapi. If a person is able to build and ship one of the plugins listed they will be paid the bounty. We want this page to be added in the submission as wel. You are open to build this page how ever you see fit.

### ‚ûï Bonus page

The website does not have to have any dynamic data coming in. It can all be hardcoded. Though we would love to have a dynamic page that fetches all the repo's from the [@strapi-community](https://github.com/strapi-community) org and showcases them in a grid of cards on it's own page. It is by no means a requirement to add this page but it can definetly be an added bonus!
